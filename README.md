# Rick and Morty API

## Description

An application that fetches data from an API with React. Used Redux to store the values for the drop down boxes instead of props. Used Bootstrap to make the application more visually appealing.

## Features

The application dynamically fetches all the data for the drop down boxes from the API data when the page is loaded because the API doesn't supply the data in a format to load the drop down boxes easily.

## APIs Used

Created using [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com)

## Deployment 

The application is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://mirfishe.github.io/rick-and-morty-api-react-redux/).
